# Project Title

## Brief Description
This project is focused on the implementation of a pipeline for fetching, retrieving, and processing data using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method. The main goal is to demonstrate a systematic approach to handle large volumes of data effectively and efficiently.

## Project Modules

### 1. Fetch
The `fetch_and_store_data.py` module is responsible for fetching data from various sources. This module ensures that the data is collected and stored in a structured format, ready for subsequent retrieval and processing.

**Approach:**
- Connect to data sources (APIs, databases, etc.).
- Fetch data and handle potential errors or exceptions.
- Store the fetched data locally or in a database.

**Logic:**
- Define functions to handle different data sources.
- Use Python libraries like `requests` for API calls or `pandas` for data manipulation.
- Ensure data integrity and storage efficiency.

```python
import fetch_and_store_data

# Example function call
fetch_and_store_data.fetch_data()
```

### 2. Retrieval
The `retrieval.py` module is designed to retrieve the stored data. This module is crucial for preparing the data for the RAG process.

**Approach:**
- Connect to the storage system where the data is kept.
- Retrieve data efficiently, ensuring minimal latency and resource usage.
- Prepare the data for processing (e.g., filtering, cleaning).

**Logic:**
- Define functions to retrieve data from various storage systems.
- Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Use efficient data retrieval techniques to handle large datasets.

```python
import retrieval

# Example function call
data = retrieval.retrieve_data()
```

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
The `rag.py` module processes the data using retrieval-augmented generation techniques. This module aims to generate contextually relevant outputs based on the retrieved data.

**Approach:**
- Implement retrieval-augmented generation algorithms.
- Use machine learning models to process the data and generate outputs.
- Ensure the outputs are accurate and contextually relevant.

**Logic:**
- Load pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., transformers).
- Integrate retrieval techniques to enhance the generation process.
- Define functions to process the data and generate outputs.

```python
import rag

# Example function call
result = rag.process_data(data)
```

## Usage
Here is an example workflow demonstrating how to use the modules together:

```python
from fetch_and_store_data import fetch_data
from retrieval import retrieve_data
from rag import process_data

# Fetch data
fetch_data()

# Retrieve data
data = retrieve_data()

# Process data using RAG
result = process_data(data)
```
